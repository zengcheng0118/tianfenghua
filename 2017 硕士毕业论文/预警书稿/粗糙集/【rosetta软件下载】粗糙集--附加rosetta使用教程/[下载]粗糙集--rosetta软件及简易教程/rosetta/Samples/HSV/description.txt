*** General information ***

The present 122-patient dataset is only the training set used in the
above references.  Results as compared on a separate validation set
are therefore not directly comparable.

*** Files and formats ***

The files present in this directory are:

   description.txt        This file.
   hsv.txt                The raw ASCII file as scanned from the book.  Each row
                          contains 11 condition attributes and 1 decision
                          attribute (the last one).  There are 122 rows.
   hsvscale.pl            A Perl script manually scaling the attributes as
                          suggested in the book.  Generates a file directly
                          readable by the RSES system.
   hsv.scaled.rses        The result of running the file "hsv.txt" through the
                          "hsvscale.pl" script.
   hsv.import.ros         Rosetta import format of the file "hsv.txt".
   hsv.scaled.import.ros  Rosetta import format of the file "hsv.scaled.rses".
