The flags dataset was scanned in from page 86 (figure P5) in:

   Schalkoff, R., "Pattern Recognition:  Statistical, Structural and 
   Neural Approaches", Wiley, 1992.

The dataset was given as an exercise in statistical pattern recognition,
with the following problem formulation:

   a) Formulate a discriminant function that, using any combination of the
      9 features, allows discrimination between class U and class C.

   b) If only one feature were allowed, which would you use?  Assume the
      criterion is to maximize classification accuracy.  What if only two
      were allowed?

   c) Assume the last ("Type") column in figure P5 is not given.  Using the
      features given, are there any natural clusters of U or C type flags?

*** General information ***

The dataset is a table listing various features of the flags of different
states of the USA, along with the information whether or not the state was
a union (U) or confederate (C) state during the civil war.  The goal of the
exercise is to see if it is possible to classify the states as being U or C,
given information about their flags.
